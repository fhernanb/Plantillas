How to debug a dockerfiles build?
==================================

1. Run the start image manually, execute the build commands.

2. For failed container:
   > docker commint <container>     # turn container to image
   > docker run -it <image> bash

3. Same but with mounted docker-config as volume in order to update fixed files in the container.
