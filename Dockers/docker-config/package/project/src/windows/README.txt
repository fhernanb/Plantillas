Transport Processes in Fractured Media

Flow123d is a simulator of underground water flow and transport
processes in fractured porous media. Novelty of this software is
support of computations on complex meshes consisting of simplicial
elements of different dimensions. Therefore we can combine continuum
models and discrete fracture network models. For more information
